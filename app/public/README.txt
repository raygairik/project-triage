JSON being language-independent and much simpler to write is definitely much easier
to read and use by humans.

XML is bulkier compared to JSON but since it has been around for quite some time,
most browsers will render XML, while it's not the case for JSON. Also there aren't
many datatypes supported by JSON. So when we are talking about ease of use for computers,
XML wins.
